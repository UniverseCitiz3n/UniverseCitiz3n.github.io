## Becoming an "IT Guy"

![Centennial Hall]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/aboutme/centennialhall.jpg)

I have started in Centennial Hall in Wroclaw in 2007. I was on my last year of studies. I wore a hat of a 1st line HelpDesk, 2nd line Admin and at the same time a 3rd line Architect of new solutions. Sometimes also a Magician with rabbits when necessary. I've learnt a ton then - installed my first Windows 2003 (32 bit) but also planned, deployed and maintained a LAN/WLAN/TV transmission for EuroBasket 2009 Championship. 

This was my first real job. The most important thing I've learnt was to **keep asking and never stop learning!**

Over the years I was resposnsible for Windows domains, Exchange and postfix servers, Sharepoint and WSUS, VMWare and Hyper-V, Cisco, Mikrotik and Unifi. My clients range from Law firms to Healthcare.

Back in 2009 I've discovered PowerShell and this is my true Love ever since.

Now, more than ever, in a world full of Azure, Microsoft 365, S2D Clusters, Hyper-V and always-lack-of-time - automation (small or big) is always welcome.

## My Journey so far has been very exciting

Gladly, times of ever growing scripts copied over and over are gone. With GIT and CI/CD even us - admins - can benefit in tasks we're struggling every day - maintenance, documentation, repetitive actions.

I'm lazy, and I hate doing the same thing more than twice.

I keep discovering, learning and re-learning every day.  I’d like to share my journey with You.

This blog is also a kind of a `notebook` for me.
