## A (NOT) long time ago in a galaxy far far away

My first enocunter with personal computer was when I was 5 years old. It had Windows 95 and 98 in dualboot. Yep I think you remember that some games from 95 did not work on 98 so keeping both was good option ðŸ˜„

Time passed...

...I've graduated from **University of Technology in WrocÅ‚aw** and I got my first job as an IT help in 2016 in **Historical Center Zajezdnia** ([Centrum Historii Zajezdnia](https://www.zajezdnia.org)). Our there my job was to take care of a dozen of desktops, a few servers (WDS,WSUS,File server), local AD, Office 365 services (Sharepoint, Exchange, etc.),VoIP, IP Cameras, Firewall but also I was responsible for audio-video coverage during events. It was fun and I had a lot of time to dig into those systems and get to know them! <br>Back then I knew that <span style="color:blue">Powershell</span> is a command prompt with some different colors ðŸ˜‚<br>
But [Mateusz](https://www.mczerniawski.pl) was more than happy to teach me why and how I should use Powershell! It opened whole new diamention being **sysadmin**. Thanks to his teachings and my determination I was able to get a job in my current company where my wings really spread.

Now I'm learning and using cutting edge technologies to <span style="color:red">automate</span> everyday tasks and repetetive processes in our team. Also I'm trying to help other teams by showing them those techonologies and help them implement some automation into their duties.
