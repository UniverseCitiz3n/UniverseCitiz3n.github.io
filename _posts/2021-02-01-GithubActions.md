# Intro

A few days ago an idea was born in my head ðŸ’¡
How can I make [Intune-App-Sandbox](https://github.com/UniverseCitiz3n/Intune-App-Sandbox) more available to everyone?
It's `PowerShell` so the most suitable form is `PowerShell` module ðŸ“¦.

# Prepare your module

It's my first 100%, build from scratch module so I had to start with the basics such as [module components and types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/module/understanding-a-windows-powershell-module?view=powershell-7.1#module-components-and-types) :

> A module is made up of four basic components:
 >
 >1. Some sort of code file - usually either a PowerShell script or a managed cmdlet assembly.
 >1. Anything else that the above code file may need, such as additional assemblies, help files, or scripts.
 >1. A manifest file that describes the above files, as well as stores metadata such as author and versioning information.
 >1. A directory that contains all of the above content, and is located where PowerShell can reasonably find it.
 <br><br>Note that none of these components, by themselves, are actually necessary. For example, a module can technically be only a script stored in a .psm1 file. You can also have a module that is nothing but a manifest file, which is used mainly for organizational purposes. You can also write a script that dynamically creates a module, and as such doesn't actually need a directory to store anything in. The following sections describe the types of modules you can get by mixing and matching the different possible parts of a module together.

After reading this I knew what had to be done.

1. Create functions for `Add-SandboxShell` and `Update-SandboxShell` and place them in folder called `Public`.
1. Other scripts and files which are true heart ðŸ’– of `Intune-App-Sandbox` I've placed in **Configuration** and **Helpers** folders.
1. Create module manifest with:

```powershell
$Description = 'This tool is for testing Powershell Script which is packed using Win32 Content Prep Tool for installing software using Win32 Deployment profile in Intune.'

New-ModuleManifest -Path .\Intune-App-Sandbox.psd1 -ModuleVersion '1.2' -Author 'Maciej Horbacz' -Description $Description
```

4. Create `PowerShell` module file which exports functions

```powershell
$Public = @(Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path $PSScriptRoot\Public\*.ps1 | Where-Object { $_ -notmatch '\.Examples.ps1' })

foreach ($import in $Public) {
 try {
  . $import.fullname
 } catch {
  Write-Error -Message "Failed to import function $($import.fullname): $_"
 }
}

Export-ModuleMember -Function $Public.Basename
```

# Test your module

Before uploading anything into public domain be sure to test it somehow locally (yes, it's to me from the past).

Thankfully you can do that with `PowerShell` modules.
Create folder somewhere on your drive e.g. `C:\LocalRepo`, this will be the path to your local repository.
Then you need to register it like that:

```powershell
Register-PSRepository -Name LocalRepo -SourceLocation 'C:\LocalRepo\' -ScriptSourceLocation 'C:\LocalRepo\' -InstallationPolicy Trusted
```

Now you can publish any module to your local repository!

```powershell
# Publish to a file share repo - the NuGet API key must be a non-blank string

Publish-Module -Path 'c:\projects\MyModule' -Repository LocalRepo -NuGetApiKey 'AnyStringWillDo'
```

# Get PSGallery secret

Create or sign in to your account on `PowerShell Gallery` and go to [API Keys](https://www.powershellgallery.com/account/apikeys)

Copy generated key and safely store it in your `repository secrets`

# Create workflow

Github actions workflows are stored at repo location .github/workflows in YAML file.

The easiest way to start building your workflows is to creating one from `Actions` tab

Before publishing check if your code is holding up to the all good practices out there.

To be sure my first workflow tests my code with `PSScript Analyzer` and `Pester` with every commit to `master` branch

```yaml
name: Test PowerShell on Windows
on: push

jobs:
  tests:
    name: Pester test and ScriptAnalyzer
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out repository code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Perform a Pester test from the Tests.ps1 file
      shell: pwsh
      run: |
        Invoke-Pester .\tests\Unit.Tests.ps1 -Passthru     
    - name: Install PSScriptAnalyzer module
      if: success()
      shell: pwsh
      run: |
            Set-PSRepository PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted
            Install-Module PSScriptAnalyzer -ErrorAction Stop
    - name: Lint with PSScriptAnalyzer
      if: success()
      shell: pwsh
      run: |
            Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path .\Intune-App-Sandbox\Public\*.ps1 -Recurse -Outvariable issues -ExcludeRule PSAvoidUsingWriteHost,PSUseShouldProcessForStateChangingFunctions
            $errors   = $issues.Where({$_.Severity -eq 'Error'})
            $warnings = $issues.Where({$_.Severity -eq 'Warning'})
            if ($errors) {
                Write-Error "There were $($errors.Count) errors and $($warnings.Count) warnings total." -ErrorAction Stop
            } else {
                Write-Output "There were $($errors.Count) errors and $($warnings.Count) warnings total."
            }
```

After you make sure that it passed the tests you can publish it!

This is where my second workflow comes in

```yaml
name: Publish PowerShell Module

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish-to-gallery:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build and publish
      env:
        NUGET_KEY: ${{ secrets.NUGET_KEY }}
      shell: pwsh
      run: |
        .\build\build.ps1
        Publish-Module -Path .\Intune-App-Sandbox -NuGetApiKey $env:NUGET_KEY -Verbose
```

>Note: build.ps1 script makes sure that NuGet provider is present and PSGallery is trusted repository

This workflow run **only when repository is published as release**.

That's all! ðŸ¥³

# Summary

From now on **Intune-App-Sandbox** is available as `PowerShell` module!

All you need to do is

```powershell
Install-Module 'Intune-App-Sandbox'
```

See you in next! ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ§
