# Intro

# How to do it

Windows stores information about wallpaper in registry for every user in their profile hives. In "HKU:\$UserSID\Control Panel\Desktop" there are three string values which you need to maniuplate:
|Wallpaper|The path to the wallpaper picture can point to a: .bmp, .gif, .jpg, .png, or .tif file|
|TileWallpaper|
* 0: The wallpaper picture should not be tiled
* 1: The wallpaper picture should be tiled| 
|WallpaperStyle|
* 0:  The image is centered if TileWallpaper=0 or tiled if TileWallpaper=1
* 2:  The image is stretched to fill the screen
* 6:  The image is resized to fit the screen while maintaining the aspect ratio. (Windows 7 and later)
* 10: The image is resized and cropped to fill the screen while maintaining the aspect ratio. (Windows 7 and later)|
