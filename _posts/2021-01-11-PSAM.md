# Intro

Using service accounts is one way to manage environment beside `Azure Service Principals`.
Having privileged account which password is not changed won't pose a great threat (unless the password is 1234 üòµ) but it is attack vector.

Alright let's assume that someone guessed password.
If this account has e.g. Global Administrator role then you are immediately Fü¶Üed.
Otherwise it's not great but under control.

Such accounts MUST be secured using top-notch, cutting edge technology.
With help comes `Azure KeyVault` üîê and  `Azure AD Privileged Identity Management` üëÆüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

# Prerequisites

* `Azure AD Privileged Identity Management` - Using this feature requires an Azure AD Premium P2 license.
* `Azure KeyVault` - Anybody with an Azure subscription
* `Azure Automation` - Anybody with an Azure subscription. First 500 minutes per month are FREE then $0.002/minute
* *(Optionally but recommended)* `Azure DevOps Repository` - If you're a Visual Studio subscriber and you get Azure DevOps as a benefit, use the Microsoft account associated with your subscription.
If you don't have a Microsoft account, choose Create one.

# Privilaged Service Account Management

On the flow chart above **PSAM** solution ends at the red line, behind it you implement your job that automation account was created for.
In my example I'm checking `Azure AD` for `Bitlocker Recovery Keys` and then taking action depend on outcome of validation script.

Let's break it down and dive in into step-by-step configuration.

## Azure KeyVault

We can start with creating `Azure KeyVault`.
It will store credentials for your Service Account.
Go to [Azure KeyVault](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.KeyVault) and fill out creation form.

![PSAM2]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM2.png)

With KeyVault created you can then add entry for your service account.

![PSAM4]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM4.png)

>Note: To implement KeyVault secrets rotation I'm inviting you to use your favorite search engine and use one of the available implementations online

## Azure Automation

Next step is to create `Azure Automation Account`.
`Azure Automation` allows you to create and run `Runbooks` that process provided code e.g. `Powershell`.
Go to [Azure Automation Account](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AutomationAccount) and fill out creation form.

![PSAM5]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM5.png)

For purposes of PSAM you will need to add 3 `Powershell` modules to your `Azure Automation`:

* Az.Accounts
* Az.KeyVault
* AzureADPreview

![PSAM6]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM6.png)

Key component of `Azure Automation` is `AzureRunAsAccount`

![PSAM7]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM7.png)

Adding this application to resources permissions you will be able to automate many aspects of `Azure` cloud.
We need to be able to **Read** `KeyVault` secrets so lets do that.
Go back to your `KeyVault` and proceed to **Access Policies** blade and click on **Add Access Policy**.

![PSAM8]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM8.png)

In next step select secrets permissions

![PSAM9]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM9.png)

Select your `AzureRunAsAccount` as principal

![PSAM10]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM10.png)

And do not forget to click **Save**!!

![PSAM11]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM11.png)

To get secret from `KeyVault` in `Powershell` runbook you just need to paste

```powershell
$AzureRunAsConnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name 'AzureRunAsConnection'

Connect-AzAccount -CertificateThumbprint $AzureRunAsConnection.CertificateThumbprint -ApplicationId $AzureRunAsConnection.ApplicationId -Tenant $AzureRunAsConnection.TenantId -ServicePrincipal

$secret = Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName 'KV-PSAM' -Name 'sa-NameResambleItsJob'

$secret

#The same goes for connecting to AzureAD
#Connect-AzureAD -TenantID $AzureRunAsConnection.TenantId -ApplicationId  $AzureRunAsConnection.ApplicationId -CertificateThumbprint $AzureRunAsConnection.CertificateThumbprint 
```

And you should be able to see results like

## Azure DevOps repository

Now that you've got automation to run your scripts, create repository for them üß±.
Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) and create a new project if you don't have one.

![PSAM13]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM13.png)

Initialize a new repo

![PSAM14]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM14.png)

Then create a new folder and file within

![PSAM15]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM15.png)

Go back to your `Automation Account` and procced to `Source Control` blade and click **Add**

![PSAM16]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM16.png)

![PSAM17]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM17.png)

Click authenticate to connect to `DevOps`

![PSAM18]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM18.png)

Fill out the rest of the form

![PSAM19]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM19.png)

>Note: Remember to set **Publish runbook** to **Yes**. Otherwise you will have to **publish** after every sync manually.

![PSAM20]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM20.png)

This is how sync should look like

![PSAM21]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM21.png)

## Azure AD Privileged Identity Management

Finally you can assign desired role to service account.
Go to [Privileged Identity Management | Azure AD roles](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_PIMCommon/ResourceMenuBlade/roles/resourceId//resourceType/tenant/provider/aadroles) and select a role.

Click **Add assignments**

![PSAM22]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM22.png)

Select your service account

![PSAM23]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM23.png)

Proceed with **Assign**

![PSAM24]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM24.png)

One last thing you will need from that blade is `roleID`. The fastest way is to copy it from address bar

![PSAM25]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2021-01-11-PSAM/PSAM25.png)

## Final

If you are reading this it means that you've gone through preparation steps of **PSAM**! ü•≥
Now it's time for the frosting of our cupcake üßÅ.

To read secret and request role using PIM you need to run:

```powershell
$AzureRunAsConnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name 'AzureRunAsConnection'

Connect-AzAccount -CertificateThumbprint $AzureRunAsConnection.CertificateThumbprint -ApplicationId $AzureRunAsConnection.ApplicationId -Tenant $AzureRunAsConnection.TenantId -ServicePrincipal

$secret = Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName 'KV-PSAM' -Name 'sa-NameResambleItsJob'

$Password = $secret.SecretValue
'Cooking service account credentials'
$saCredentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList ('sa-NameResambleItsJob@XXXXXX.onmicrosoft.com', $Password)

'Disconnecting from Az'
Disconnect-AzAccount

Import-Module AzureADPreview

"Connecting to AzureAD"
Connect-AzureAD -Credential $saCredentials | out-null

'Creating PIM schedule'
$roles = Get-AzureADMSPrivilegedRoleDefinition -ProviderId aadRoles -ResourceId $AzureRunAsConnection.TenantId
$schedule = New-Object Microsoft.Open.MSGraph.Model.AzureADMSPrivilegedSchedule
$schedule.Type = "Once"
$schedule.StartDateTime = (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime().ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ")
$schedule.endDateTime = (Get-Date).AddMinutes(30).ToUniversalTime().ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ")     

"Requesting permissions"
Open-AzureADMSPrivilegedRoleAssignmentRequest -ProviderId 'aadRoles' -ResourceId $AzureRunAsConnection.TenantId -RoleDefinitionId '7698a772-787b-4ac8-901f-60d6b08affd2' -SubjectId '25fca288-42e8-4ef3-8546-4305d7ba197c' -Type 'UserAdd' -AssignmentState 'Active' -schedule $schedule -reason "Powershell test"

```

That's nicely formatted output from `Runbook`

# Summary

Having so heavily protected service account with those few tools gives you great advantage against attackers üë®‚Äçüíª.
To make this solution better you can make `Automation Account` variables for `roleID` or configure `PIM` to send mail notification to desired distribution list with information that role has been assigned üì©

See you in next! üòâ üß†
