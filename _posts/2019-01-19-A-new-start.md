# New Year - new challenges

With new Year 2019, I've decided to move my blog to GitHub and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

I've started with [wordpress.com](https://arconnetblog.wordpress.com) as it was quick and easy to get my first posts live. I didn't know back then if I'll be able to write regularly or if I'll like it. Now that I've finally started writing more often, time has come to re-think. There are few reasons behind this:

- I want my own domain
- I don't want to bloat my posts with ads.
- I want layout to be clear and simple
- I want to learn markdown
- I hate mobile experience from `wordpress.com` (not inserting gists properly) 

After reading a few great posts
- [Build blog using GitHub-Jekyll](https://nikhita.github.io/build-blog-using-github-jekyll) by [*Nikhita Raghunath*](https://nikhita.github.io/about/)
- [Setting up blog part 1](http://kylestratis.com/2015/04/17/blog-setup/) and [part 2](http://kylestratis.com/2015/05/05/blog-setup-pt2/) by [*Kyle Stratis*](http://kylestratis.com/) 
- [Building blog](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) by [*Barry Clark*](http://www.barryclark.co/) 
- [GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) 

I tried with a few themes, but [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) seems to be the best for my purpose. Although it may seem complicated at first, it allows for a lot. My favorite being image embedding.

I've decided I will give it a go. So here I am. There is still a lot of work and learning to be done. I'm new to css, classes and all this jazz so if You'll see any bugs or glitches - let me know. 

I will move all the content from my [Wordpress blog](https://arconnetblog.wordpress.com) eventually! So [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown) help me!
