# Installing a new font in Windows

This can't be difficult, right? It is just drag and drop. Get your newest shiny font, open `c:\windows\Fonts` and drop it there. This should also be very easy to automate then. Well, ouch! There would be no post then:)

## Gathering the pieces

I started with simplest possible solution - I tried copying file to `C:\Windows\Fonts`. I was requested by providing administrative credentials (I'm not running with scissors :) ). Good. Confirmed that drag and drop is working as expected. That won't be a viable solution for 20+ workers uploading different fonts daily. Oh, and they don't have admin rights either!

I tried copying the file with `Copy-Item -Credential`. It worked but font was not registered. I've created proper registry entry in `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts`
but that didn't do the trick either. 

Sure enough the font was visible in Fonts folder but was not accesible by any application.

# Let the hunt begin

I've used some google-fu [here](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/deploymentguys/2010/12/04/adding-and-removing-fonts-with-windows-powershell/) and [there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12165856/how-do-i-pass-option-flags-to-folder-copyhere-in-powershell) and it seems that:
- copying the file using `Shell.Application` methods and proper copy flag options 
- creating the registry entry manually 

is enough. 

The road to victory seemed cleared. Just one last monster to slay - to add proper registry key I needed the *TRUE* font name, not the file name. How to retrieve additional properties of a font file (those from 'details' tab)?

![Font]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/add-font/picture1.png) 

Those properties are not accessible by any built-in PowerShell cmdlet. I could either use another `Shell.Application` object and retrieve the Title (or iterate through the 288 properties... Mick Pletcher has a [nice article](http://mickitblog.blogspot.com/2016/07/powershell-retrieving-file-details.html) about it, or I could use System.Drawing assembly for that.

# Got the meat, let's plan

I had all the information I needed to get the cooking planning going. First function flow looked like this:

![Flow1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/add-font/picture2.png)

I wanted to be able to either add one file or point to a directory with fonts, but not both. What about some failsafes? I wanted to be sure that only appropriate file types will be selected and copied to `C:\Windows\Fonts` folder. Also I wanted to copy the file only if it wasn't there already. Imagine a user having a folder with bunch of fonts and adding new ones there, while keeping the old one "just for reference". 

So the final flow is something like:

![Flow1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/add-font/picture3.png)

# Let the coding begin
Let's start the fun part. To accept only one parameter I've used `ParameterSetName` in Param() block for each parameter.  Parameter `$Path` accepts only containers (folders) and is labeled `'Directory'`. Parameter `$FontFile` accepts only files and is labeled `'File'`. To have 'Directory' set as default I added an additional declaration in CmdletBinding() section

{% gist 6b810492856a84e09c89a5a76a93c9ae %}

The `Begin{}` block initializes variables. To create a `Shell.Application` with proper flags ReadOnly variable `$Fonts` is created with special `ID (0x14)`. I'm also using `copyFlag options 4+16` which means 'Do not display a progress dialog' (which it still does!) and 'Respond with "yes to all" for any dialog box that is displayed' to avoid bothering popups during the process.

{% gist 92de8c9f0477822d27d1f1676eb8d859 %}

Next interesting thing is getting font files whether directory or file was provided. I'll need object with properties (Full Path, Name) so I'll `Get-ChildItem` through, but only if file has allowed extension:

{% gist 1da8acca51256e95bb98b70dc43182af %}

While in the `foreach-object` loop and not-yet-registered font condition, I'll retrieve `'Details'` properties from the font file with `S`ystem.Drawing` type object:

{% gist 8d153f25f18351c80acbc58b13f40685 %}

Still in the loop, I'll copy the file and create registry entry if needed:

{% gist c170281ed3ce75ac2fe59ce7d44ce9d0 %}

# Additional information

[Add-Font](https://github.com/PPOSHGROUP/PPoShTools/blob/master/PPoShTools/Public/FileSystem/Add-Font.ps1) function is a part of PPoShTools module which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/PPOSHGROUP/PPoShTools). I like verbosity of my code- it is way easier to debug what went wrong with your automation tools just by looking at the logs. I'm using Write-Log (also a function from PPoShTools module). By default it writes to screen, but with setting a proper context (Set-LogConfiguration ) I can have all my functions in current running workspace log to file or event log instead. No need to rewrite the code!

As always, if you have any comments - feel free to contact me.
