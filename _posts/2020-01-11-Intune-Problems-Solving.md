# Intro

Happy New Year!ü•≥ Starting 2020 I promised myself to increase frequency of the posts so fingers crossed that it works outüòâ

In this post you will find couple of steps that are worth to try if your device is having problems enrolling to Intune. I can't guaranty that will help with every device. That's why you should think of this post as check list of things to keep in mind while debugging workstation.

'-biospassword' setting updated with value 'YourBiosPass'.
Execution completed.
Program exited with return code: 0
