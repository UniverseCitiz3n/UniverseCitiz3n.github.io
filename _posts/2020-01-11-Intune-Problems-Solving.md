# Intro

Happy New Year!ü•≥ Starting 2020 I promised myself to increase frequency of the posts so fingers crossed that it works outüòâ

In this post you will find couple of steps that are worth to try if your device is having problems enrolling to Intune. I can't guaranty that will help with every device. That's why you should think of this post as check list of things to keep in mind while debugging workstation.

My environment configuration:

* Hybrid Azure AD Join
* Auto-enrollment to Intune with GPO

Things that will come in handy during troubleshooting:

* dsregcmd /status - cmdlet which shows is device is AAD joined. More [details](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/azure/active-directory/devices/troubleshoot-device-dsregcmd)
* Event Viewer - Application and Services Logs:
    - Microsoft/Windows/AAD
    - Microsoft/Windows/DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider
    - Microsoft/Windows/User Device Registration
* Systeminfo

# BIOS

Check if your device has up-to date BIOS version. Sometimes simple plain update will get things moving. If you are using Dell laptops it is best to use **Dell Command | Update** tool. Version 3.1.0 brought at of nice improvements and features!
``` powershell

Write-Host 'This is a code'

```

See you in next! üòâ üß†
