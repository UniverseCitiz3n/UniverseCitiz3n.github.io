Nobody likes clicking on over and over the same thing just to get your job done. That is why I've started to automate things ðŸ˜„. Everythings goes smoothly if service provider gives you tools like <span style="color:yellow">APIs</span>, <span style="color:blue">Powershell</span> cmdlets,<span style="color:green">WebHooks</span>, etc. But how to get things done on website if those tools are **no good**? You can use Selenium! And what is Selenium? Well it automates browser and that's it and without further ado...

# Getting started
What you will need is Webdriver.dll you can grab some version from [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bins/Selenium)
