# Intro

What value brings maintenance if we do not monitor its results?
In this post I will show you how you can easily create `Azure workbook` with data from `Log analytics`.
The data we will take a look at are generated by runbook from this post - [Verify Azure AD Bitlocker Keys with Microsoft Graph](https://universecitiz3n.tech/powershell/Graph-Bitlocker/).
One last thing...I've updated code in post to provide more useful data and seamless compliance with `log analytics`.

# Log analytics

Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal to edit and run log queries from data collected by Azure Monitor Logs and interactively analyze their results.
You can use Log Analytics queries to retrieve records matching particular criteria, identify trends, analyze patterns, and provide a variety of insights into your data.
To be able to understand and create your own queries you will need to get familiar with `Kusto query language` (**KQL**).

For that and more visit - [Log Analytics tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial).

The fastest way to read outputs from your runbooks is to enable **diagnostic settings**.
Navigate to your automation account and proceed with adding new diagnostic settings:

![azure1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2021-04-15/azure1.png)

Then, enter name for your setting and choose log analytics workspace:

![azure2]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2021-04-15/azure2.png)


See you in next! ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ§
