# Intro

Hi there!
For some time I've been thinking about creating a few posts on starting your own **Windows Autopilot** small lab.
This lab is **Hyper-V** based so prepare your strongest hardware or dust off your servers and enjoy!

# Microsoft 365 tenant

Windows Autopilot is cloud solution which purpose is to bring devices into management state over the Internet.

This requires...ü•Åü•Å...Microsoft 365 tenant with licenses!

THE BEST way to get your own POC/sandbox/place where you can break things is to request **Microsoft 365 Developer Program** üôå

Simply, go [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) and fill-out the from!

You will get Microsoft 365 E5 instant sandbox with:

* 25 user licenses for development purposes
* Fully loaded sample data with 16 sample users, user data, and content to help you model your solutions.
* Easy access to pre-provisioned core Microsoft 365 workloads and capabilities (Windows not included), including:
    * All Office 365 apps
    * Everything you need for Power Platform development
    * Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection
    * Advanced analytics with Power BI
    * **Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) for compliance and information protection** üëàüëà
    * Azure Active Directory for building advanced identity and access management solutions

All this and more for free!

Where is a catch? Such sandbox has renewable expiration period of 90 days.

How to renew it? You need to create some activity within environment.
From my experience it does not have to be anything complicated.
I had periods when I signed-in to tenant clicked through some stuff once in 3 months and it was sufficient üòÅ

See you in next! üòâ üß†
