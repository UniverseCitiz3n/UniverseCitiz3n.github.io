# Intro

Happy New Year!ü•≥ Starting 2020 I promised myself to increase frequency of the posts so fingers crossed that it works outüòâ

In this post you will find couple of steps that are worth to try if your device is having problems enrolling to Intune. I can't guaranty that will help with every device. That's why you should think of this post as check list of things to keep in mind while debugging workstation.

My environment configuration:

* Hybrid Azure AD Join
* Auto-enrollment to Intune with GPO

Things that will come in handy during troubleshooting:

* dsregcmd /status - cmdlet which shows is device is AAD joined. More [details](https://docs.microsoft.com/pl-pl/azure/active-directory/devices/troubleshoot-device-dsregcmd)
* Event Viewer - Application and Services Logs:
    - Microsoft/Windows/AAD
    - Microsoft/Windows/DeviceManagement-Enterprise-Diagnostics-Provider
    - Microsoft/Windows/User Device Registration
* Systeminfo

# BIOS update

Check if your device has up-to date BIOS version. Sometimes simple plain update will get things moving. If you are using Dell laptops it is best to use **Dell Command | Update** tool. Version **3.1.0** brought at of nice improvements and features! I like using it from Powershell terminal and it is very simple:

``` powershell
#Go to location of installation
cd 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Dell\CommandUpdate'
#Firstly you need to set bios password if you have one
.\dcu-cli.exe /configure -biospassword="YourBiosPass"
#Response should be
'-biospassword' setting updated with value 'YourBiosPass'.
Execution completed.
Program exited with return code: 0
#Updating BIOS
.\dcu-cli.exe /applyupdates -autoSuspendBitLocker
#Tool will scan device for any drivers that need update. For BIOS update laptop needs to connected to power source and -autoSuspendBitLocker is needed too.
```

after reboot update will be applied.

# Boot mode

Some devices might have been configured so long time age that its partition style is **MBR** and it still runs in **Legacy mode** with **Secure boot Off**. It can changed without reinstalling OS! Conversion to GPT feels like a huge risk so if you have a way to backup whole disk it **recommend** that. But I've done it on two different laptops in FullOS Mode and in Windows 10 Safe Mode with Command-prompt and it worked both times! More details about the tool [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/mbr-to-gpt). Keep in mind that changes cannot be undone and device will only boot in **UEFI mode**. So if you are doing it remotely you will need **Dell Command | PowerShell Provider** to make changes in BIOS from Windows.

``` powershell
#It is good to run validate parameter first
c:\Windows\System32>.\mbr2gpt /validate
MBR2GPT: Attempting to validate disk 0
MBR2GPT: Retrieving layout of disk
MBR2GPT: Validating layout, disk sector size is: 512
MBR2GPT: Validation completed successfully
#If you are doing this from Widnows use /allowFullOS
c:\Windows\System32>.\mbr2gpt /convert /allowFullOS

MBR2GPT will now attempt to convert disk 0.
If conversion is successful the disk can only be booted in GPT mode.
These changes cannot be undone!

MBR2GPT: Attempting to convert disk 0
MBR2GPT: Retrieving layout of disk
MBR2GPT: Validating layout, disk sector size is: 512 bytes
MBR2GPT: Trying to shrink the system partition
MBR2GPT: Trying to shrink the OS partition
MBR2GPT: Creating the EFI system partition
MBR2GPT: Installing the new boot files
MBR2GPT: Performing the layout conversion
MBR2GPT: Migrating default boot entry
MBR2GPT: Adding recovery boot entry
MBR2GPT: Fixing drive letter mapping
MBR2GPT: Conversion completed successfully
MBR2GPT: Before the new system can boot properly you need to switch the firmware to boot to UEFI mode!

```

Now with the help of another awesome Dell tool I will be changing boot mode

``` powershell
Install-Module -Name DellBIOSProvider

Get-Item DellSmbios:\BootSequence\BootList | select *

PSPath                    : DellBIOSProvider\DellSmbiosProv::DellSmbios:\BootSequence\BootList

                             when secure boot is enabled or Legacy Option ROM is disabled.

Set-Item DellSmbios:\BootSequence\BootList -Value Uefi

Get-Item DellSmbios:\SecureBoot\SecureBoot | select *                                           

PSPath                    : DellBIOSProvider\DellSmbiosProv::DellSmbios:\SecureBoot\SecureBoot

                            CAUTION: Using the Dell Command | PowerShell Provider, you cannot disable this feature. NOT
                            E: One of the methods of configuring this feature is from the BIOS setup screen.

Set-Item DellSmbios:\SecureBoot\SecureBoot -Value Enabled
```

Now it is safe to reboot!

See you in next! üòâ üß†
